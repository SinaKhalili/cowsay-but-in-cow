# cowsay-but-in-cow
I wrote cowsay in cow

You have to use my [fork](https://github.com/SinaKhalili/COW) of the cow compiler.

## Usage
```
cowcompile cowsay.cow
./cow.out "hello"
```
Will output 
```
hello
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

You may have noticed the he does not have any speech bubbles and no command line options. This is because I had already way spent too much time writing silly cow programs to add this. Pull requests welcome.
